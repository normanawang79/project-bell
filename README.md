# Bell Individual Project-Norman Bin Awang


## About 
This project is about creating a landing page of a website that functions as a one-stop portal where users can access massage places/individuals based on the different types of massage treatments provided. 

## The Problem 
Most massage websites offer many treatments and it is time-consuming for users to read the whole website, to look for their preferred massage treatments and then repeat this process by visiting and comparing other massage websites before finally deciding on which treatment they want. 

## The Solution
So, this portal is created to minimise the time spent by users surfing many websites by providing a one-stop service where users can just click on any of their preferred massage treatment on the right sidebar. They will get to read the general description of the treatment and below the description, they could click on the link that directs them to all the massage providers that offer that specific massage treatment.  

## Other features
This website has other features that users can navigate to. On the navigation bar, users can read reviews about the specific massage services from the various massage providers, submit feedback of the website itself and massage services via the online form and as for advertisers, they can contact the portal admin to ask about the advertising rates, etc. 

Users can also read the benefits of using male masseurs on the main part of the landing page and at the bottom of the website, the users will be redirected to the link where they can read the reviews about massage services, just in case they miss out this part on the navigation bar.
