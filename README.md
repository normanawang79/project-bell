# Project Name: One-Stop Portal Service for M4M Massages
This project is about creating a landing page of a website that functions as a one-stop portal where users can access massage places/individuals based on the different types of massage treatments provided. 

One or two paragraphs providing an overview of your project. Tell us about your project.

Essentially, this part is your sales pitch.


## Design Process
The Problem: Most massage websites offer many treatments and it is time-consuming for users to read the whole website, to look for their preferred massage treatments and then repeat this process by visiting and comparing other massage websites before finally deciding on which treatment they want. 

The Solution: So, this portal is created to minimise the time spent by users surfing many websites by providing a one-stop service where users can just click on any of their preferred massage treatment on the right sidebar. They will get to read the general description of the treatment and below the description, they could click on the link that directs them to all the massage providers that offer that specific massage treatment.  


Provide us insights about your design process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory) Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url.

## Features
Existing Features: This website has other features that users can navigate to. On the navigation bar, users can read reviews about the specific massage services from the various massage providers, submit feedback of the website itself and massage services via the online form and as for advertisers, they can contact the portal admin to ask about the advertising rates, etc. Users can also read the benefits of using male masseurs on the main part of the landing page and at the bottom of the website, the users will be redirected to the link where they can read the reviews about massage services, just in case they miss out this part on the navigation bar. 

Features Left to Implement: Advertisements and so on. 

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5 
- CSS3 
- Bootstrap 

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.

## Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
