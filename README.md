# Project Name: One-Stop Portal Service for M4M Massages
This project is about creating a landing page of a website that functions as a one-stop portal where users can access massage places/masseurs based on the different types of massage treatments provided. 


## Design Process
The Problem: Most massage websites offer many treatments and it is time-consuming for users to read the whole website, to look for their preferred massage treatments and then repeat this process by visiting and comparing other massage websites before finally deciding on which treatment they want. 

The Solution: So, this portal is created to minimise the time spent by users surfing many websites. The portal acts as a one-stop service where users can just click on any of their preferred massage treatment and will have access to the brief description of the massage treatment as well as the massage providers providing that specific massage treatment. 

## Features
Existing Features: 

Right sidebar: Users can click on any of the listed massage treatments to get access to the brief information regarding the massage treatment and below the information, there is a link where users can click on to access the contacts of the massage providers providing that specific massage treatment. 

Main: Users can read the general benefits of using male masseurs for massage treatments. 

Navigation bar:  Users can read reviews about the specific massage treatments from the various massage providers. They can also submit feedback regardidng the website itself and massage services via the online form. As for advertisers, they can contact the portal admin to ask about the advertising rates to advertise on the portal etc. 

Footer: At the bottom of the website, the users will be redirected to the link where they can read the reviews about massage services, just in case they miss out this part on the navigation bar. 

Features Left to Implement: 

Advertisements shown on the header section of the website. 

Search function on the review section where users can type the name or the massage treatments directly and have access to the relevant information needed.
